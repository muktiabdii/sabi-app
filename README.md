  <b>SABI (Sampah Bisa Jadi Berarti) - Mobile App (Jetpack Compose) 🌱</b><br>
</h2>

As a team passionate about sustainable tech solutions, we developed this **Mobile App for Smart Waste Management** to empower individuals in turning everyday waste into meaningful contributions. Through this platform, users can donate waste, collect reward points, and exchange them into money, donate to orphanages, or support local UMKM businesses.

This project was created collaboratively as part of the **Internship Raion 2025**, where we aimed to combine social impact with thoughtful mobile development. Built using **Jetpack Compose and Firebase**, the app showcases clean architecture practices while focusing on real-world community challenges.

Our goal is to encourage **responsible waste behavior, support local economies**, and make sustainability accessible through technology. The project is still growing, and we're excited to keep improving it together!

Feel free to explore, share feedback, or get inspired. Let's make sustainability smarter—together! 🌱💡🚀
